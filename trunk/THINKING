  * time to add grouping so traslation, rotation, etc. can be played
    with

08mar18
  * need to map :view-box -> viewBox=  in attribute output (utils.lisp)

08mar20
  * indenting levels of grouping now works, and paragraph filling,
    for neater XML reading

08apr11
  * oy
  * use multiply embedded groups to add functionality (movability,
    transparency, color themes, etc)
  * I have a very bad feeling a complete rewrite might be in order

08apr19
  * rewrite done, now on to gradients and symbols
  * needed next: FILL PATTERNS, markers
  * also needed: path and lines helper functions
  * note that an XML element may have several classes (space-separated
    quotes), so that different kinds of functionality can be created
    with appropriate class groups
   
08apr20
  * more powerful generalizations for the group elemens macrofied
  * I don't understand <marker ...> elements at all

08may07
  * markers work, even if I don't get them
  * patterns work just dandy
  * added a top-level DRAW* definition to throw a usage warning

08may08
  * http://osku.de/svg/gui-examples/xypad.svg for trivial dragging
  * <script /> and <style /> elements
  * just plain ol' <g />

08may10
  * cleaning up the <text> mess

08may12
  * trivial masks
  * fiddling with pretty pictures

08may13
  * first, wretched pass at path helpers, later improved; might need a
    reworking, or I can announce in huge letters that only pathing
    commands should be used within WITH-PATH and PATH

08may15
  * small tweaks, added LINK for clickable, linked items
  * need to work more on the PATH interface - it could be smarter
    about line breaks (fixed 08may26)

08may17
  * transformations added over the last few days; some cleanup and a
    few more docstrings, but actual documentation is in order now
  * the GUI stuff may belong in an entirely different library

08may26
  * documentation, documentation
  * a few refinements and convenience macros
  * probably ready for a first packaging - the lively GUI sorts of
    things will be in a different library sitting on top of this one
  * probably should add a bunch of examples to the documentation
  * otherwise, somewhere around 95% ready for a first release
